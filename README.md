### Written Work in Computer Science 
The above repository is a recent collection of research notes and finished work, gathered with the intention of demonstrating my writing. Below is a summary of its contents:

* *An Investigation into Data Commerce*: An academic white paper describing the proliferation and potential consequences of the United States' burgeoning data brokerage industry
* *Digital Astroturfing â€“ Literature Review*: Unsurprisingly, a literature review profiling standout academic work on the subject of digital astroturfing
* *book-notes*: An informal collection of notes regarding a larger breadth of computer science topics and interests, from Section 230 to Neural Networks. 

**Notes**: None of us truly work alone! Citations for relevant works are provided with each respective written work.
